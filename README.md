# WebTestRunner Explorer for Visual Studio Code

(wip)

[WebTestRunner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) [Explorer UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer) adapter.

This is very early work, it's a hacky solution using undocumented/private APIs so likely will break in the future, but for now it runs web-test-runner tests in watch mode and reports the errors (both in the sidebar and highlighting the line in the test).

[Help is welcome!](https://github.com/stagas/vscode-web-test-runner-explorer)
